 # Topics Covered
1. HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)
HTTP is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web.
It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how web servers and browsers should respond to various requests.
Common methods include GET (retrieve data), POST (send data), PUT (update data), and DELETE (remove data).
2. How the Internet Works
The Internet is a global network connecting millions of computers and devices.
Data travels across the Internet in small packets via routers and switches.
Communication relies on protocols like TCP/IP to ensure data is sent and received reliably.
Web browsers interact with servers using URLs and HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
3. DNS (Domain Name System)
DNS translates human-friendly domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other.
When a domain is entered in a browser, a DNS query is sent to find the IP address of the server hosting that website.
DNS servers are distributed globally to ensure efficient and reliable lookups.
4. API (Application Programming Interface)
APIs are sets of rules that allow different software applications to communicate with each other.
Web APIs often use HTTP to allow interaction between client applications and servers.
APIs enable features like fetching data from a server, sending data, and integrating third-party services.
5. HTML Terminology
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures content on the web.
Basic terms include:
Elements: Building blocks of HTML 
Tags: Markup used to define elements 
Attributes: Provide additional information about elements
Key Takeaways
Understanding HTTP and APIs is crucial for web development and communication between services.
Knowing how the Internet and DNS function helps in troubleshooting connectivity and domain issues.
Familiarity with HTML terminology is essential for structuring and designing web pages.
